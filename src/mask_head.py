# TODO:
    
# Considerations and Missing Elements

#     Output Shape: Consider the desired resolution of your final mask predictions. Do you want them to match the original ROI size or a different resolution? You might need additional upsampling or resizing to achieve the correct output shape.

#     Loss Function: The most common loss function for instance segmentation is binary cross-entropy applied at the pixel level. Make sure you implement a loss that compares the predicted masks to the ground truth masks.

# Next Steps:

#     Upsampling/Resizing: Decide on your desired mask resolution and adjust your network architecture if needed.
#     Loss Implementation: Implement the mask loss, likely using binary cross-entropy in TensorFlow.
