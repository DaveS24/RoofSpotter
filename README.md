# RoofSpotter: Automated Roof Detection Using Mask R-CNN

RoofSpotter is an advanced machine learning and deep learning project aimed at automating the detection of house rooftops in satellite images, specifically tailored for the Bavarian region of Germany. Leveraging "The Bavarian Buildings Dataset", which provides detailed building footprint information combined with high-resolution imagery, RoofSpotter employs a Mask R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) architecture to precisely identify and outline rooftop structures.
Mask R-CNN is a robust deep learning model capable of simultaneously detecting object instances and generating pixel-wise segmentation masks, making it well-suited for tasks requiring precise spatial localization.
