# RoofSpotter: Automated Roof Detection Using Machine Learning

RoofSpotter is a machine learning and deep learning project aimed at automating the detection of house roof locations in images obtained from satellite imagery providers like Google Maps or street-level views. The project utilizes state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to analyze images and identify regions corresponding to rooftops.

The system will receive input images through an API, process them using a pre-trained neural network model, and output images with bounding boxes or rectangles outlining the detected roof areas. The primary focus will be on accurately identifying and delineating individual roof structures within the images.

The project will involve several key steps, including data collection, preprocessing, model development, training, evaluation, and deployment. To achieve robust and accurate performance, the model will be trained on diverse datasets containing a wide variety of roof types, orientations, and environmental conditions.
